# Hi, I'm Ellen. 

My favorite question to ask is "why?"  It's been a major guiding principle throughout my career; even more importantly in my work as a developer and UX practitioner. 

In a former life I was a publicist for books, video games, and tech startups, but building things on the web has always been what I want to do.

On a snowy day you'll find me knitting or making things in the kitchen; on a sunny day I run long distance, ride my bike around Brooklyn, and occasionally venture to Staten Island for golf.
