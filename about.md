# About Me

It's not about me, it's about you:

Your project, your objectives, your needs.

I build websites, emails, and online user experiences.  But more than that, I build tools that can go to work for you.  You won't get templated work from me (unless you ask for a template!).  I'll listen to what problems you face today and your hopes for the future, then deliver web assets created to meet your goals and no one else's.  You'll get functional web assets built to serve your needs for a long time. 

Because everything I do, I do it for you.
