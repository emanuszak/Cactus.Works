My favorite question to ask is "why?"  It's been a major guiding principle throughout my career; even more importantly in my work as a developer and UX practitioner.  

In a former life I was a publicist for books, video games, and tech startups, but building things on the web has always been what I want to do.

On a snowy day you'll find me knitting or making things in the kitchen; on a sunny day I do distance running, ride my bike, and occasionally venture to Staten Island for golf.
