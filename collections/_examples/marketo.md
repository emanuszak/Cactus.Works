## The end goal
Reduce email marketing dependency on developers to code each communication, and provide ways for marketers to own the production of their emails.

## The existing problem
The client was originally developing each email individually using a variety of templates.  I built a flexible, modular template for use inside the Marketo drag-and-drop email editor.

## The challenge
Each module needed to work in a wide range of design contexts.  I wanted to focus on reusability to reduce the amount of repeatitive modules and total code in the final template.  

## The result
