project_description: A one-page wedding announcement website and responsive email invitation with a custom online RSVP
---
<section class="project-overview">
	<h3>Problem and Existing Comps</h3>
	<p>The available products for online invitations and RSVPs didn't suit our needs.  Services like Paperless Post and Minted tried to carry over the mailed invitation experience, which ran counter to wanting a email invitation.  EVite and other wedding-specific products were clunky and didn't offer enough customization.</p>
</section>

<h3>Target audience</h3>
<p>We actually had a three-fold audience: the hosts, our invited guests, and those to whom we wanted to announce our marriage. </p>

<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>From our own experiences and from knowing our guests, we understood that RSVP replies were often put off until the last minute or forgotten.  While the idea of paper invitations was received positively, it also required more work on behalf of both audiences to send and reply.  <p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>An email invitation and RSVP system.  Based on recipient email addresses and prior knowledge of device usage, I optimized the emails specifically for Gmail (which meant no media queries) and Apple Mail.</p>

<h3>Design principles</h3>
<p>Casual and conversational.  Simple and straightforward. </p>

<h3>Mapping the experience</h3>
<p>We didn't want to make our guests work when they received the invitation&mdash;it didn't make sense to create an online version of what is ostensibly the same, traditional RSVP card.  So instead of asking our guests to fill in their name and information, we did it for them.  Then, guests simply needed to verify and confirm with a few clicks.</p>

</ol>
<h3>User flow</h3>

<h3>Post-deployment analysis</h3>
<p>In an effort to stick by the conversational design principle, we strayed too far into cute wording that wasn't as informative as it could have been. As a result, some users were a bit confused when selecting their responses.</p>
