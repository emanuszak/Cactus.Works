## The task
A top 20 Fortune 500 financial institution was migrating their email marketing to Marketo.  

## Role
Front-end developer

## Approach & Challenges
The client was originally using many separate email templates that were developed individually and uploaded to their ESP for each communication.  Marketo utilizes a drag-and-drop methodology, allowing marketers to build their own emails as needed.

## The steps

### Audit
First, I audited the past year+ of email communications that had been sent out.  By identifying repeating design patterns, I was able to come up with a library.

### Designing functionality
Decide the requirements for how marketers would be able to interact with each module.

### Standardizing
Next was making sure each piece was a standard size.  There were emails of different widths, depending on who had designed them.
