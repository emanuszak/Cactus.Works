			<h2>Who is Ellen?</h2>
				<p>I'm a front-end designer and recovering public relations professional.<p>
				<p>I spent the first part of my career doing strategic communications and media relations in various industries&mdash;most recently I've launched startups and helped tech companies share their stories.</p>
				<p>I taught myself how to code as a kid making Geocities sites.  I want to get back to that original passion and start actually building tech as a full-time web developer.  I offer more than just technical ability to push pixels; my background in PR gives me a unique perspective on how code and content work together to effectively deliver brand messaging.</p>
				<p>My personal interests include health and fitness&mdash;I run distances from the 5K to the marathon, stand-up paddleboard in the Hudson River, bike around Brooklyn and Manhattan, and I occasionally venture to Staten Island to golf.</p>
				<p>I'm available for hire for web development projects, and select public relations work.</p>
