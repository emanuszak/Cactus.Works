I make websites and HTML emails in Brooklyn.  My skills are a cross-section of technical, UX, and communications.

I've done work for a top twenty-five Fortune 500 financial institution, a global television programming company, and others. I also wrote a book on coding responsive HTML emails. Check out some of the [projects I've done](work.html) or get in touch with me via the form below.
